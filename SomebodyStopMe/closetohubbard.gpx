            waypoint, Xcode will simulate that specific location. If you provide multiple waypoints,

                Optionally provide a time element for each waypoint. Xcode will interpolate movement
                at a rate of speed based on the time elapsed between each waypoint. If you do not provide
                a time element, then Xcode will use a fixed rate of speed.
          
                Waypoints must be sorted by time in ascending order.
